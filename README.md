Bachellor Thesis - Stabilization of the Variable-Height Inverted Pendulum based on Input-State Stability and Sliding Mode Control under Unilateral Contact and Input Saturation.

Abstract:

Mantain the balance when a robot is pushed forward is fundamental for legged robots. An essential topic in the literature is capture point, it is the place where the robot must put its legs to keep the balance. In this work, we study the variable-height inverted pendulum as a model for a pushed robot. We found all the points and the possible places which are allowed to be a capture point for given initial velocities of the center of mass and actuator limitations. We also develop a controller to reach that capture point using the reaction force to the ground as input variable. We pay attention to the unilateral contact and the maximum-value saturation reaction force. We first obtain the necessary conditions that must be satisfied to be able to achieve balance. Then we present a control law to stabilize the system and we show that the region of attraction is equivalent to the region of the necessary condition for balance. Finally we briefly discuss the physic places where balance can be achieved.
